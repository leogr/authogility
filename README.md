Auth*gility
-----------

The name MUST be a mashup of **auth** (that can stand for both **authentication** and **authorization**) and **apigility** (and/or **agility**).

Candidates:

- authogility (where "o" suffix remands to the **_auto_ mation** of authentication process and to the **_o_ auth**)
- authigility (where "i" suffix remands to the use of **ap _igility_**)
- authagility ("agility" suffix remands to the the possibility to implement the authentication process in an **agile** way)

### TODO

1. TravisCI
    * Add GH_TOKEN env variable contained the crypted Github key
    * Add Slack webhooks?
